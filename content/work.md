### Liver Simulated Allocation Model
Organ allocation isn't working too well in the US. I worked with [mathematicians](https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/gentry/index.php), data from the [Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients](http://www.srtr.org), and used simulation models to study hypothetical allocation systems that give people with liver disease a fairer chance at a life-saving liver transplant, regardless of where they live.

### Kidney Paired Donation
The [National Kidney Registry](http://www.kidneyregistry.org) arranges domino kidney transplants in the US.  We studied the associations between transporting kidneys (and the time they are put on ice) and how well the kidneys and patients do. This required plenty of data cleaning, linking, and survival/logistic regression in Stata.

### Detecting Pneumonia with Machine Learning
Can a stethoscope and a smartphone be used to listen to your breathing and warn you about abnormal sounds? [Clinicloud.com](http://clinicloud.com) has the answer to this problem. I worked with them to develop neural-net algorithms for heart-rate and pneumonia detection in R.

### Patient-Centered Decision Modelling
I wrote Markov models in C (and PhP) to help inform patient-centered decision problems.  In one problem, kids with kidney disease have to decide whether they should accept a donated kidney from someone they know, or if they should wait to get one from the list and "save" the other one for later.
