### Medical Illustrations
I could always draw very well.  I had an elementary school art teacher who would always say that I had "the eye" in a very freaky ominous way.  I'm not sure where this eye is, but I think I just have very excellent fine motor skills.  I started drawing like this when I was about 11 years old.  At the time, my favorite subject were dinosaurs.

Here's another example. For those familiar with Gray's Anatomy, you may notice that my inspiration for these sketches come from there.  Except this cross section of a heart. I forget where I saw this from.

I had a shoulder injury recently, so I studied the anatomy of the joint, muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  This (and the brain) are my more recent works.  The shoulder is pretty complicated, but drawing it out helped me understand my injury better.

Alright, back to our regular program of science!
