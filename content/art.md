### Medical Illustrations
I could always draw very well.  I had an elementary school art teacher who would always say that I had "the eye" in a very freaky ominous way.  I'm not sure where this eye is, but I think I just have very excellent fine motor skills.  I started drawing like this when I was about 11 years old.  At the time, my favorite subject were dinosaurs.

Here's another example. For those familiar with Gray's Anatomy, you may notice that my inspiration for these sketches come from there.  Except this cross section of a heart. I forget where I saw this from.

Here is a study I did of the anatomy of the shoulder. I did it because I had a shoulder injury from climbing, and I learned that the shoulder is hella complicated.

Alright, back to our regular program of science!
