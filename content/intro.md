Hello, I'm Eric! Currently, I am a medical student at the Chicago Medical School at the Rosalind Franklin University with interests in wilderness medicine, critical care, and also radiology. Previously, I was a Biostatistician at Stanford Medicine in the [Quantitative Sciences Unit](https://med.stanford.edu/qsu.html) where I worked with a variety of physicians on study design, power calculation, and analyses.  Before that, I was a senior research data analyst at Johns Hopkins, where I worked with some really [cool doctors and epidemiologists](https://transplantepi.org/) on kidney and liver transplant problems in the US.  I'm all about improving and saving lives.

My stance on data-science is that it should be hypothesis-driven, and not data driven. I'm a pro at survival analysis, Markov modelling, decision processing modelling, regression, and stochastic simulation. I also do study design, power calculation, and statistical analysis plans (ie: I know intimately what a p-value is and how not to mis-use it). I'm originally trained as an industrial engineer from the University of Toronto. But I also have my masters in decision sciences from the London School of Economics, and also a masters in health informatics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

I code in Stata, R, SAS, and also C for speed. The whitespace of Python drives me crazy, but I do it when I have to.  I climb mountains and rocks on the weekends. I am a trainee Search and Rescue volunteer with the Bay Area Mountain Rescue Unit [(BAMRU)](http://www.bamru.org), where I search for people who are lost or injured in the mountains California.

Check out [some examples of my work](#work).
