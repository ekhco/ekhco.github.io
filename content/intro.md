Hello, I'm Eric! Currently, I am a medical student at the Chicago Medical School at the Rosalind Franklin University with interests in wilderness medicine, critical care, and also radiology. Previously, I was a Biostatistician at Stanford Medicine in the [Quantitative Sciences Unit](https://med.stanford.edu/qsu.html) where I worked with a variety of physicians on study design, power calculation, and analysis.  Before that, I was a senior research data analyst at Johns Hopkins, where I worked with some really [cool doctors and epidemiologists](https://transplantepi.org/) on kidney and liver transplant problems in the US.  I'm all about improving and saving lives.

I'm a pro at survival analysis, Markov modelling, decision processing modelling, regression, and stochastic simulation. I also have experience with study design, and power analysis. I'm originally trained as an industrial engineer from the University of Toronto (so I know discrete optimization too!). But I also went to London UK for my masters in decision sciences from the London School of Economics (because I wanted to live in Europe), and also a masters in health informatics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (because I watched Hairspray).

I code in Stata, R, SAS, and also C for speed. The whitespace of Python drives me crazy, but I do it when I have to.  I climb mountains and rocks on my weekends. I am a trainee Search and Rescue volunteer with the Bay Area Mountain Rescue Unit [(BAMRU)](http://www.bamru.org), where I search for people who are lost or injured in the rugged mountainous terrain of California.

Check out [some examples of my work](#work).
