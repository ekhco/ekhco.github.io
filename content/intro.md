Hello, I'm Eric! Currently, I work at Stanford Univeristy in the Quantitative Sciences Unit as a Biostatistician.  Before that, I spent 5 years at Johns Hopkins Univeristy in Baltimore, where I worked with some really [cool doctors and epidemiologists](https://transplantepi.org/) on kidney and liver transplant problems in the US.  I'm all about improving and saving lives.

I'm a pro at survival analysis, Markov modelling, decision processing modelling, regression, and stochastic simulation. I'm originally trained as an industrial engineer from the University of Toronto (so I know discrete optimization too!). But I also went to London UK for my masters in decision sciences from the London School of Economics (because I wanted to live in Europe), and also a masters in health informatics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (because I watched Hairspray).

I speak Stata, and R, but also write in C when I want it to be fast. I only suffer Python for tensorflow.  I climb mountains and rock-faces on my weekends, and will travel to far away mountain ranges for more extended trips.

Check out [some examples of my work](#work).
