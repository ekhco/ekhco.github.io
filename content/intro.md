Hey. I'm Eric, a radiology resident at Stanford. I did medical school at the Rosalind Franklin University. Previously, I was a Biostatistician at Stanford Medicine in the [Quantitative Sciences Unit](https://med.stanford.edu/qsu.html) where I worked with a variety of physicians on study design, power calculation, and analyses.  Before that, I was a senior research data analyst at Johns Hopkins, where I worked with some really [cool doctors and epidemiologists](https://transplantepi.org/) on kidney and liver transplant problems in the US.

My undergrad was in industrial engineer at the University of Toronto. I also have my masters in decision sciences from the London School of Economics, and also a masters in health informatics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

I code in Stata, R, SAS, and also C for speed. The whitespace of Python drives me crazy, but I do it when I have to.

Check out [some examples of my work](#work).
