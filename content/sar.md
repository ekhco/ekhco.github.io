I have been a Mountain Search and Rescue Volunteer with the Bay Area Mountain Rescue Unit [(BAMRU)](http://www.bamru.org) in California since 2018. In my first year, I logged 350+ operational hours in over a dozen searches in the Sierras and all over the state. It's not easy! Training in my first-year took 500hrs (my training is still ongoing) and I have to work effectively and safely with my team-mates under circumstances of extreme pressure. I was awarded 2018 Rookie of the year in "recognition of exceptional volunteer service and outstanding BAMRU achievements."

As a mountain SAR volunteer, I was on-call 24-7 to respond to lost hikers and climbers in the most difficult and remote mountain terrain in California. Ocassionally, we get flown in by helicopter and are expected to be self-sufficient for 72hrs; but usually we hike in and out and are supported very generously by the local communities whom we are serving.

How did I get into this? Well, I've been rock climbing and recreating in the mountains for over two decades. I can lead 5.9ish trad in Yosemite. This is what I look like on weekends:
