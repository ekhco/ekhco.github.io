I have been a Mountain Search and Rescue Volunteer with the Bay Area Mountain Rescue Unit [(BAMRU)](http://www.bamru.org) in California since 2018. In my first year, I logged 350+ operational hours over 13 searches in the Sierras and all over the state. I was awarded Rookie of the year.

As a mountain SAR volunteer, I was on-call 24-7 to respond to lost hikers and climbers in the most difficult and remote mountain terrain in California.
