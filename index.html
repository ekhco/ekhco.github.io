Hello, I&rsquo;m Eric! I live in California. Currently, I work at Stanford Univeristy in the Quantitative Sciences Unit as a Biostatistician.  Before that, I spent 5 years at Johns Hopkins Univeristy in Baltimore, where I worked with some really <a href="https://transplantepi.org/">cool doctors and epidemiologists</a> on kidney and liver transplant problems in the US.  I&rsquo;m all about improving and saving lives.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a pro at survival analysis, Markov modelling, decision processing modelling, regression, and stochastic simulation. I&rsquo;m originally trained as an industrial engineer from the University of Toronto (so I know discrete optimization too!). But I also went to London UK for my masters in decision sciences from the London School of Economics (because I wanted to live in Europe), and also a masters in health informatics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (because I watched Hairspray).</p>

<p>I speak Stata, and R, but also write in C when I want it to be fast. I only suffer Python for tensorflow.  I climb mountains and rock-faces on my weekends, and will travel to far away mountain ranges for more extended trips.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="#work">some examples of my work</a>.</p>

<h3 id="liver-simulated-allocation-model">Liver Simulated Allocation Model</h3>

<p>Organ allocation isn&rsquo;t working too well in the US. I worked with <a href="https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/gentry/index.php">mathematicians</a>, data from the <a href="http://www.srtr.org">Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients</a>, and used simulation models to study hypothetical allocation systems that give people with liver disease a fairer chance at a life-saving liver transplant, regardless of where they live.</p>

<h3 id="kidney-paired-donation">Kidney Paired Donation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kidneyregistry.org">National Kidney Registry</a> arranges domino kidney transplants in the US.  We studied the associations between transporting kidneys (and the time they are put on ice) and how well the kidneys and patients do. This required plenty of data cleaning, linking, and survival/logistic regression in Stata.</p>

<h3 id="detecting-pneumonia-with-machine-learning">Detecting Pneumonia with Machine Learning</h3>

<p>Can a stethoscope and a smartphone be used to listen to your breathing and warn you about abnormal sounds? <a href="http://clinicloud.com">Clinicloud.com</a> has the answer to this problem. I worked with them to develop neural-net algorithms for heart-rate and pneumonia detection in R.</p>

<h3 id="patient-centered-decision-modelling">Patient-Centered Decision Modelling</h3>

<p>I wrote Markov models in C (and PhP) to help inform patient-centered decision problems.  In one problem, kids with kidney disease have to decide whether they should accept a donated kidney from someone they know, or if they should wait to get one from the list and &ldquo;save&rdquo; the other one for later. <a href="http://www.transplantmodels.com">Check out the online decision-tools I have made here.</a></p>

<h2>How to Build a Website with Blogdown</h2>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial shows you how to build a professional site using blogdown (an R package), Hugo (a static site builder), and host it on GitHub. Static sites have advantages (fast loading) since they are flat HTML pages, and disadvantages (less interactive). Another advantage is showcasing your <code>R-code</code> in markdown files!</p>
</div>
<div id="create-an-empty-repository-on-github" class="section level3">
<h3>Create an Empty Repository on GitHub</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To start, create a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account if you don’t already have one.</li>
<li>Create a new empty repository and name it “your_username.github.io” - this will be your new site.</li>
<li>Clone the new empty repository to your local computer the way you normally would (<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">Git Bash</a> in Windows, or <code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your_username.git</code> in terminal on a Mac)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="installing-homebrew-the-blogdown-package-and-hugo" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing Homebrew, the <code>(Blogdown)</code> Package, and Hugo</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> is a missing package manager for MacOS and installs a bunch of stuff so you can install Hugo later. Open a terminal and paste in the install script (also found in the Homebrew link above):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Launch Rstudio and create a new project using the “Existing directory” of the cloned GitHub from above. Blogdown is a package you install like any other R package. I do it through Rstudio since it has a built in viewer to preview your website once you start building it. In the R terminal of Rstudio, install the devtools package, the blogdown package, and Hugo with this code:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># the devtools package helps you download blogdown
install.packages(devtools)  
library(devtools)

# use devtools to install blogdown
devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/blogdown&quot;) 
library(blogdown)

# install hugo using blogdown
install_hugo()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-new-site" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a New Site</h3>
<p>Now that you have blogdown and hugo, you can create a new site using the blogdown function. The second line installs a Hugo website theme by <a href="https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-strata-theme">digitalcraftsman</a>. You can checkout lots of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo themes here</a>. Clicking on the “Homepage” button will take you to the Github where the theme is stored. To change your installed theme, just change the “github_username/theme_name” in the code. You can update the theme at anytime. Make sure your working directory is still the repository for <code>your_username.github.io</code> in Rstudio:</p>
<pre><code># creates a new empty site using the blogdown function
new_site()

# install a Hugo website theme
install_theme(&quot;digitalcraftsman/hugo-strata-theme&quot;, theme_example=TRUE, update_config=TRUE)

# build and preview the website in Rstudio
serve_site()</code></pre>
<p>A bunch of things happened! files were created in your local directory. You also installed a Hugo theme. It’s not live yet, but you can view it in the Rstudio viewer (that’s what <code>serve_site()</code> did). Click the “Stop” to get your prompt back in Rstudio. This is all local on your computer. We have to do a few more setup things before we can “deploy” the site to GitHub:</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-hugo-and-github-to-work-together" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Hugo and GitHub to Work Together</h3>
<p>GitHub and Hugo work a bit differently, so we need to setup a work-around so that your site can be deployed to GitHub. We do this with GitHub branches:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Go to your repository on GitHub. Click on the button “Branch:<strong>master</strong>” and in the text box, name it: “sources”. Click “<strong>Create branch: sources</strong> from ‘master’”</p></li>
<li><p>We need to switch the default branch from ‘master’ to ‘sources’: Click on the “<strong>2</strong> branches”&quot; link, and click on “<strong>Change default branch</strong>” to change it to ‘sources.’ Github will freakout a bit, tell it that it’s okay and everything will be fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s pull ‘sources’ down to our local directory. In terminal, <code>cd</code> to your GitHub working directory (your_username.github.io) and type:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>git checkout sources</code></pre>
<p><strong>WARNING: THE FOLLOWING WILL DELETE ANY CONTENT IN YOUR MASTER BRANCH!</strong></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://hjdskes.github.io/blog/deploying-hugo-on-personal-gh-pages/index.html">Jente Hidskes</a> wrote a convenient script that sets up your local website repository for deployment using Hugo.

In the codeblock below, change the <code>USERNAME=hjdskes</code> to your GitHub username, and <code>SOURCE=hugo</code> to ‘SOURCE=sources’</li>
