Hello, I&rsquo;m Eric! Currently, I work at Stanford Univeristy in the Quantitative Sciences Unit as a Biostatistician.  Before that, I spent 5 years at Johns Hopkins Univeristy in Baltimore, where I worked with some really <a href="https://transplantepi.org/">cool doctors and epidemiologists</a> on kidney and liver transplant problems in the US.  I&rsquo;m all about improving and saving lives.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a pro at survival analysis, Markov modelling, decision processing modelling, regression, and stochastic simulation. I&rsquo;m originally trained as an industrial engineer from the University of Toronto (so I know discrete optimization too!). But I also went to London UK for my masters in decision sciences from the London School of Economics (because I wanted to live in Europe), and also a masters in health informatics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (because I watched Hairspray).</p>

<p>I speak Stata, and R, but also write in C when I want it to be fast. I only suffer Python for tensorflow.  I climb mountains and rock-faces on my weekends, and will travel to far away mountain ranges for more extended trips.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="#work">some examples of my work</a>.</p>

<h3 id="medical-illustrations">Medical Illustrations</h3>

<p>I could always draw very well.  I had an elementary school art teacher who would always say that I had &ldquo;the eye&rdquo; in a very freaky ominous way.  I&rsquo;m not sure where this eye is, but I think I just have very excellent fine motor skills.  I started drawing like this when I was about 11 years old.  At the time, my favorite subject were dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example. For those familiar with Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy, you may notice that my inspiration for these sketches come from there.  Except this cross section of a heart. I forget where I saw this from.</p>

<p>I had a shoulder injury recently, so I studied the anatomy of the joint, muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  This (and the brain) are my more recent works.  The shoulder is pretty complicated, but drawing it out helped me understand my injury better.</p>

<p>Alright, back to our regular program of science!</p>

<h3 id="spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection">Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection</h3>

<p>I am the statistical lead on a multi-center study of SCAD. I advise the primary investigators on study design, matching of cases and controls, appropriate statistical methods, and data collection. I have a junior statistician who helps me with this, which is nice.</p>

<h3 id="liver-simulated-allocation-model">Liver Simulated Allocation Model</h3>

<p>Allocation of donated organs to people with liver disease is challenging in the US. I worked with <a href="https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/gentry/index.php">mathematicians</a>, data from the <a href="http://www.srtr.org">Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients</a>, and used simulation models to study hypothetical allocation systems that give people with liver disease a fairer chance at a life-saving liver transplant, regardless of where they live.</p>

<h3 id="kidney-paired-donation">Kidney Paired Donation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kidneyregistry.org">National Kidney Registry</a> arranges domino kidney transplants in the US.  We studied the associations between transporting kidneys (and the time they are put on ice) and how well the kidneys and patients do. This required plenty of data cleaning, linking, and survival/logistic regression in Stata.</p>

<h3 id="detecting-pneumonia-with-machine-learning">Detecting Pneumonia with Machine Learning</h3>

<p>Can a stethoscope and a smartphone be used to listen to your breathing and warn you about potentially abnormal conditions? <a href="http://clinicloud.com">Clinicloud.com</a> has the answer to this problem. I worked with them to develop neural-net algorithms for heart-rate and pneumonia detection in R.</p>

<h3 id="patient-centered-decision-modelling">Patient-Centered Decision Modelling</h3>

<p>I wrote Markov models in C (and PhP) to help inform patient-centered decision problems.  In one decision problem, kids with kidney disease have to decide whether they should accept a kidney from a willing donor that they know, or if they should wait to get one from the deceased donor waitlist and &ldquo;save&rdquo; the other one for later. <a href="http://www.transplantmodels.com">Check out the online decision-tools I have made here.</a></p>
